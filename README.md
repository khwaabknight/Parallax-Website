# Parallax-Website
Made a Website Using HTML and CSS. The top image gives a Parallax effect i.e., farther thing move slower than closer things(it happens when the different elements of a page move at different speeds â€” creating a 3D depth effect).  Concepts used: -> HTML -> CSS -> Flex-Box -> CSS Positioning Property -> 3-D transformations -> Background attachments
